# credit-risk-classification

## Overview
#### Employ various supervised machine learning techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Evaluate a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

#### Data analysis consisted of splitting the data points into training and testing sets, followed by the creation of a logistic regression model using the original data set. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated by generating a confusion matrix and classification report to identify how well the model predicts both healthy and high-risk loans. Features assessed within the data set to determine credit-worthiness include:

* Loan size\
* Interest rate\
* Borrower name\
* Debt to income\
* Number of accounts\
* Derogatory marks\
* Total debt\
* Loan status
